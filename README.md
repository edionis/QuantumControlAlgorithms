# QuantumControlAlgorithms
This repository contains code and resources from my PhD research in quantum control, focusing on the implementation and optimization of techniques like GRAPE algorithm and the shooting method. The goal is to enhance control and manipulation of quantum systems for applications in quantum computing and information processing.
